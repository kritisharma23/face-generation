# Generate Faces
This project is a part of **Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree** Program.

## Project Overview
This project defines and trains a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. The goal is to get a generator network to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible!
The project is broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. 


 **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** is used to implement it. The [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) is used to train the network.
 
 ## Technologies Used
 
 1. Python (version 3.6.3)
